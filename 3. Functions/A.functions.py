"""
Functions are a fundamental part of Python (and most other programming
languages). Python includes many built-in functions, but you can also create
your own functions which are also known as user-defined which we create.

A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

A function typically performs a specific task that you can run in your program.
For example, print() is a built-in Python function that allows you to display text
to the screen. Calling print("Hello") results in Hello being displayed.

Examples:

NOTE: most we will be using camel & snake case

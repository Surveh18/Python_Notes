"""
To create a class, use the keyword class:
Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:
"""


class Myclass:
    # attributes - Variables which are declared inside the class.
    # methods - Functions which are declared inside the class.
    x = 5


"""
Create Object
Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:
Create an object named p1, and print the value of x:
"""

p1 = Myclass()  # object creation/instance of class
print(p1.x)

ðŸ§  What Is Nonlocal Scope?
Nonlocal scope is when a variable lives between local and global 
â€” it's inside an outer function, and a nested inner function can access and 
change it using the nonlocal keyword.

ðŸ—‚ Think of It Like This:
Imagine you have a notebook (the outer function) and you write down a word.
Then you open the notebook again and change that word from inside a smaller sticky note 
(the inner function). Youâ€™re not creating a new word, youâ€™re updating the one you wrote earlier.
